Vet runs the Go vet command on the packages named by the import paths.

For more about vet and its flags, see 'go doc cmd/vet'.
For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.
For a list of checkers and their flags, see 'go tool vet help'.
For details of a specific checker such as 'printf', see 'go tool vet help printf'.

The -n flag prints commands that would be executed.
The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.

The -vettool=prog flag selects a different analysis tool with alternative
or additional checks.
For example, the 'shadow' analyzer can be built and run using these commands:

  go install golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow/cmd/shadow
  go vet -vettool=$(which shadow)

The build flags supported by go vet are those that control package resolution
and execution, such as -n, -x, -v, -tags, and -toolexec.
For more about these flags, see 'go help build'.
