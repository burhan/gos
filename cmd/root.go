Gos: Armed Golang ðŸ’ª

from now on, use gos instead of go:

go get => gos get
go build => gos build
go ... => gos ...

gos is compatible with all go commands and has go mod/get equipped with smart GOPROXY, 
it automatically distinguishes between private and public repositories 
and uses GOPROXY to download your lost package when appropriate.

gos has a few extra commands to enhance your development experience:

  cross      agile and fast cross compiling
  proto      quick and easy compilation of proto files

You can use -h on these sub commands to get more information.
