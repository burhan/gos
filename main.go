Pacakge main is the starting point of gos program

from now on, use gos instead of go:

    go get => gos get
    go build => gos build
    go run => gos run
    go ... => gos ...

gos is compatible with all go commands and has go mod/get equipped with smart GOPROXY, it automatically distinguishes between private and public repositories and uses GOPROXY to download your lost package when appropriate.

gos has a few extra commands to enhance your development experience:

    cross      agile and fast cross compiling
    proto      quick and easy compilation of proto files
    ...

You can use -h on these sub commands to get more information.
